## Overview

This document is for data experts, Data Engineering, ETL engineers, and systems engineering professionals evaluating, developing with Senzing Software in production to integrate their data sources.

The Senzing Software (TM) performs entity resolution – determining when entities are the same or related within and across data sources. This specification focuses on persons or organizations, such as customers, prospects, vendors, employees, and watch lists. It contains a dictionary of pre-configured attributes used to resolve and relate people or companies and outlines the process of creating data sets with them so that they are readily consumable by the Senzing engine. The dictionary also serves to identify what features in the data is desirable to perform entity resolution. Data must be presented to the engine in either a JSON or CSV file format using the dictionary registered attributes contained in this specification prior to loading.

## Selecting Data Sources & Subsets

### Evaluating Senzing

If you are currently evaluating Senzing for your use and data cases, we recommend you use our workbook for data source selection to:

- Document your business goals
- Define your use and data cases
- Consider the sample subsets from your sources.

### Production Systems - Integrating More or Expanding Use Cases

Which data sources you select to load to your product system deeply depend on the value you seek from adding that information to your understanding of the actors (people & companies) in your ecosystem. If you are looking to expand your use of Senzing Software for new use cases or enrich your current use would like help considering which data sources are most valuable to your goals, [contact us](https://senzing.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). We are happy to help you imagine what is possible.

[Suggested add image from mapping primer]

Senzing entity resolution works best when as many relevant features as possible are mapped from your source data. In the next section, we will look at examples of features of map people and companies. We've provided the corresponding samples for people and companies in [CSV](https://github.com/Senzing/senzing-entity-specification/tree/main/docs/samples/csv) and [JSON](https://github.com/Senzing/senzing-entity-specification/tree/main/docs/samples/json) via Github.

These files contain the likely fields you will run into when mapping organizations to the default entity format. In fact, you should try to map as many of these fields as possible.

### Sample Person Features

- Primary name
- Date of birth and gender
- Passport, driver's license, social security number, national insurance number
- Home and mailing addresses
- Home and cell phone numbers
- Email and social media handles
- Groups that they are associated with such as their employer name
- Any key dates, statuses or amounts that can help you find meaning in the matches. For instance, a vendor related to an employee who influences purchases is more important than the same vendor associated with an employee that doesn't.

### Sample Features for An Organization

The [sample_company.csv](samples/csv/sample_company.csv) can be used to map your data to if desired. There is also a corresponding [sample_company.json](samples/json/sample_company.json) file if you prefer. The sample organization structure contains the follow fields:

- Primary name
- Tax ID number, like employer identification number
- Other ID numbers, like a Dunn and Bradstreet number
- Primary and mailing addresses
- Primary and other phone numbers
- Website and social media handles
- Any key dates, statuses or amounts that can help you find meaning in the matches. For instance, a current company you do business with that is on a watch list for bad reasons is more important than the same match to a company you did business with several years ago.

#### Recommendation

We recommend JSON due to its hierarchical structure, which allows for multiple names, addresses, phones, etc. to be presented in a single structure as one record may have only one address and another may have five. Whereas CSV files are flat and multiple values must be presented as additional columns, if the maximum number of addresses is five, all rows in the CSV file will include space for five addresses, whether needed for that record or not.

### Creating JSON files

Below is the basic structure of a JSON record the engine can consume. Note that most attributes are at the root level. However, lists must be used when there are multiple values for the same attributes.

#### Sample JSON structure for a People

*Notes:*

- `DATA_SOURCE` code is required, must be UPPER CASE and not greater than 25 characters.
- `RECORD_ID` is always desired.
- `NAME_LIST` is multiple name segments are placed in a list
- `ADDRESS_LIST` is multiple Address segments placed in a list, where there are multiple addresses you will choose a "TYPE" like HOME and MAIL
- `PHONE_LIST` is multiple phone numbers are placed in a list with a tagged TYPE. E.g. 'WORK' and 'CELL'

### Creating CSV files

Mapping csv files is normally accomplished by replacing the column header names with the registered attributes names contained in this specification.

Column names in a CSV must be unique, so multiple values for attributes such as multiple names, multiple addresses, must be prefixed with a term denoting the type of name, address, phone number.

Here is the list of column headers that could be used to flatten out the JSON example above in the previous code blocks.

| Attribute | Description|
| ----------- | ----------- |
| DATA_SOURCE | Defaults to the setting in the project file if not supplied on every record|
| RECORD_ID | A record ID is always desired |
| PRIMARY_NAME_LAST | In the JSON this appears "NAME_TYPE": PRIMARY. Now PRIMARY is moved to the column prefix. |
| PRIMARY_NAME_FIRST | For each name feature in the PRIMARY list seen the JSON, PRIMAY becomes the column prefix|
| PRIMARY_NAME_MIDDLE | see above |
| AKA_NAME_LAST | Continue pattern of using the "NAME_TYPE": VALUE as the prefix continues across multi-attribute features|
| AKA_NAME_FIRST | |
| AKA_NAME_LAST | |
| AKA_NAME_MIDDLE | |
| DATE_OF_BIRTH | |
| SSN_NUMBER | |
| HOME_ADDR_LINE1 | Continue pattern of using the "ADDRESS_TYPE": VALUE "HOME" as the prefix across multi-attribute ADDRESSES|
| HOME_ADDR_CITY | |
| HOME_ADDR_STATE | |
| HOME_ADDR_POSTAL_CODE | |
| MAIL_ADDR_LINE1 | "ADDRESS_TYPE": MAIL, used for the column prefix of all attributes of the address|
| MAIL_ADDR_CITY | |
| MAIL_ADDR_STATE | |
| MAIL_ADDR_POSTAL_CODE | |
| CUST_SINCE_DATE | Fields not used for resolution can still be included with their original names |
| CUST_STATUS | See above |
| AGE_BRACKET | |
| INCOME_LEVEL | |

#### Mapping CSV Files

 A mapped csv file actually looks this and is usually accomplished by simply replacing the current column headers with corresponding attribute labels and names in this specification.

| RECORD_ID | PRIMARY_LAST_NAME | PRIMARY_FIRST_NAME | PRIMARY_MIDDLE_NAME|
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1001 | Adams | Alan | James |
| 1002| Baker | Betty | Lynn |
| 1003 | Cooper | Cindy | Rose |

## Dictionary of Registered Attributes

Senzing is an entity repository that helps locate records for the same entity across data sources. Think of it as a pointer system to where an entity's records can be found. These are the fields required to tie the records in Senzing back to the contributing sources.

### Record Key Attributes

| Attribute Name| Type | Required | Example | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| DATA_SOURCE| String | Optional | CUSTOMER | **IMPORTANT**: Data Source IDs must not exceed 25 charaters and be in UPPER CASE. This is an important designation for reporting. Naming your data sources allows you to distiqush between records that orgniate from different systems or special loads like watchlists. |
| RECORD_ID | String | Desired | 1001 | If the records in your data source have a unique record ID use that value here. |

### Use of Record IDs

When loading records from specific sources, it is useful to prefix the record ID with the source.

Examples:

| Data Source| Record ID | Mapped Record ID | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| EMPLOYEES | 012934 | employees_012934|Include the data source name with the record id from that source|
| CUSTOMERS | 0012746 | customers_0012746|(same as above)|
| TRANSACTIONS | gh342301 | transactions_gh342301| **Non-keyed Lists**: An event or transaction with identifying information about a non-keyed or external entity such as a money transfer to an external party. The record_id in this case would be the transaction_id. |
| SPREADSHEET | leave blank | *system generated* | **Non-keyed Lists**: Leaving the record_id blanks will cause the sytem to generate one automatically.

Important

- Usually, an entire file of records will be assigned the same **DATA_SOURCE** which is why it is marked optional above. Both the G2Loader in the direct install and StreamLoader in the docker install offer the ability to assign a default DATA_SOURCE to a file. This is explained further in the *[Loading Data Handbook.*](handbooks/loading-data-handbook.md)

### Name Attributes for Individuals or Organizations

A name is a highly desirable feature to map. Most resolution rules will require a matching name.

| Attribute name | Type | Example | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| NAME_TYPE| String | PRIMARY, ALIAS, NICK | Most data sources have only one name, but when there are multiple, there is usually one primary name and the rest are aliases. Whatever terms are used here should be standardized across the data sources included in your project.|
| NAME_ORG | String | Acme Tire Inc. | This is the organization name. |
| NAME_LAST | String | Smith | This is the last or sur name of an individual.|
| NAME_FIRST | String | Robert | This is the first or given name of an individual.|
| NAME_MIDDLE | String | John |This is the middle name of an individual.|
| NAME_PREFIX | String | Mr | This is a prefix for an individual's name such as the titles: Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr, etc.|
| NAME_SUFFIX | String | SR | This is a suffix for an individual's name and may include generational references such as: JR, SR, I, II, III, and/or professional designations such as MD, PHD, PMP, etc. |
|NAME_FULL| String | Robert J Smith | **IMPORTANT** Parsed names are preferred where the Last, First, and Middle names separate attributes in the data. You should only use full name if a parsed name is not available. This feature is the full name of an individual as a single string. Senzing Software will not allow both a full name and the parsed names to be populated in the same set of name fields. [See duplicate columns handling later in this document.]|

Important

- The "PRIMARY" **NAME_TYPE** helps select the best name to display for an entity. See Special attribute types and labels for when to use this. It is always best to specify name type.
- The NAME_FULL attribute is provided if the parsed name fields are unavailable. For example, you would not map both NAME_FULL and any other name fields in the same name segment.
- If there is a common or nickname field, it represents a "second" name the individual is known by. In this case, map a second set of name columns duplicating the last name with the common name.

If using NAME_ORG, this record should be about an organization, not an individual, i.e., do not map any individual name fields. You would not map both a NAME_ORG and any other name fields in the same name segment.

- Sometimes, there are both an organization name and a person's name on a record, such as a contact list where you have the person and for whom they work. In this case, you would map the person's name as a name and the company as their employer. See **Attributes for group associations** for more information on this critical distinction.

### Addresses Attributes

Addresses are important, especially when identifiers are not available. Therefore, Senzing will make one of the more common resolutions on name and address.

| Attribute name | Type | Example | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
|ADDR_TYPE | String | HOME | This is a code that describes how the address is being used such as: HOME, MAILING, BUSINESS*, etc. Whatever terms are used here should be standardized across the data sources included in your project.|
| ADDR_LINE1| String | 111 First St | This is the first address line and is required if an address is presented.|
| ADDR_LINE2 | String | Suite 101 | This is the second address line if needed.|
| ADDR_LINE3 | String | This is the third address line if needed.|
| ADDR_LINE4| String ||This is the fourth address line if needed.|
| ADDR_LINE5 | String ||This is the fifth address line if needed. |
| ADDR_LINE6 | String ||This is the sixth address line if needed. |
| ADDR_CITY | String | Las Vegas | This is the city of the address.|
| ADDR_STATE | String | NV |This is the state or province of the address.|
| ADDR_POSTAL_CODE | String | 89111 | This is the zip or postal code of the address.|
|ADDR_COUNTRY| String | US | This is the country of the address.|
|ADDR_FULL | String| |This is a single string containing all address lines plus city, state, zip, and country. Sometimes data sources have this rather than parsed address. Only populate this field if the parsed address lines are not available.|
|ADDR_FROM_DATE | Date | 2016-01-14 | This is the date the entity started using the address if known. This information is used to determine the latest value of this type in use by the entity.|
|ADDR_THRU_DATE| Date |This is the date the entity stopped using the address if known.|

Important

- The **ADDR_FULL** attribute is provided if the parsed address fields are unavailable. For example, you would not map both an **ADDR_FULL** and any other address fields in the same address segment.
- The "BUSINESS" **ADDR_TYPE** adds weight to physical business addresses. See Special attribute types and labels for when to use this.

### Phone Number Attributes

Like addresses, phone numbers can be crucial, especially when identifiers are not available. A common resolution made by Senzing is based on name, phone, and date of birth.

| Attribute name | Type | Example | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| PHONE_TYPE | String | FAX, HOME, MOBILE | This is a code that describes how the phone is being used such as: HOME, FAX, MOBILE*, etc. Whatever terms are used here should be standardized across the data sources included in your project.|
|PHONE_NUMBER| String | 111-11-1111| This is the actual phone number. They can include country codes.|
|PHONE_FROM_DATE | Date | 2016-01-14 | This is the date the entity started using the phone number if known. It is used to determine the latest value of this type in use by the entity. |
| PHONE_THRU_DATE | Date | 2021-07-06 |This is the date the entity stopped using the phone number if known.|

Important

- The "MOBILE" phone type adds weight to mobile phones. See Special attribute types and labels for when to use this.

### Physical and Other Descriptive Attributes

 Physical attributes can like DATE_OF_BIRTH help reduce over-matching (false positives). Usually, gender and date of birth are available and should be mapped if possible.

| Attribute name | Type | Example | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
|GENDER | String | M | This is the gender, such as M for Male and F for Female. You can pass through single letters or longer strings if expressing transitioned or transitioning individuals |
|DATE_OF_BIRTH | String | 1980-05-14 | This is the date of birth for a person. NOTE: P|artial dates such as just month and day or just month and year are accepted.|
|DATE_OF_DEATH | String | 2010-05-14 | This is the date of death for a person. Again, partial dates are accepted.|
|NATIONALITY| String | US |This is where the person was born and should contain a country name or code|
|CITIZENSHIP| String | UK | This is the country of which the person is a citizen and should contain a country name or code.|
|PLACE_OF_BIRTH|String| US |This is where the person was born. Ideally, it is a country name or code. However, they often contain city names as well.|
| RECORD_TYPE | String | PERSON | This is a good value to include if known and persons are resolving to organizations. Use standardized terms like PERSON and ORGANIZATION across all your data sources.|
|REGISTRATION_DATE | String | 2010-05-14 | This is the date the organization registered, like a person's date of birth.|
| REGISTRATION_COUNTRY | String | US | This is the country the organization was registered in, like a place of birth is to a person. |

### Government-issued Identifier Attributes

Government-issued IDs help to confirm or deny matches. If available, you should map the following identifiers.

| Attribute name | Type | Example | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
|PASSPORT_NUMBER | String | 123456789 | This is the passport number.
| PASSPORT_COUNTRY | String | US | This is the country that issued the ID.|
| DRIVERS_LICENSE_NUMBER | String | 123456789| This is the driver's license number.|
| DRIVERS_LICENSE_STATE | String | NV | This is the state or province that issued the driver's license.|
|SSN_NUMBER | String |123-12-1234 | This is the US Social Security number.|
| SSN_LAST4 |String | 1234| This is just the last4 digits of the SSN for use when the full SSN is not available.|
| NATIONAL_ID_NUMBER | String | 123121234 | This is the national insurance number issued by many countries. It is similar to an SSN in the US.|
| NATIONAL_ID_COUNTRY| String | CA | This is the country that issued the ID. |
| TAX_ID_TYPE | String | EIN | This is a company's tax ID number, as opposed to an SSN or NIN for an individual.|
| TAX_ID_NUMBER| String | 123121234 | This is the actual ID number.|
| TAX_ID_COUNTRY | String | US | This is the country that issued the ID.|
| OTHER_ID_TYPE | String | CEDULA | This is the type of any other identifier, such as registration numbers issued by other authorities than listed above.|
| OTHER_ID_NUMBER | String | 123121234 | This is the actual ID number.|
| OTHER_ID_COUNTRY | String | MX | This is the country that issued the ID number.|
| TRUSTED_ID_TYPE | String | TRUE_SSN | The type of ID that is to be trusted. See the note below
| TRUSTED_ID_NUMBER | String | 123-45-1234 | The trusted unique ID.

Important

- A **TRUSTED_ID** is a very special identifier that will resolve records together even if they have different names, dates of birth, or other identifiers. For example, suppose the SSN of a data source is trusted such that it should resolve records despite other differences. In that case, it can also be mapped as a **TRUSTED_ID_NUMBER** with the **TRUSTED_ID_TYPE** of "SSN" to resolve within and across data sources that are so trusted.
- A **TRUSTED_ID** can also be used to force records together or apart manually. Before use, please [read the documentation.](https://senzing.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023523354-How-to-force-records-together-or-apart)
- Use **OTHER_ID** sparingly! It is just a catch-all for identifiers you don't understand well but still want to use to help match records to entities. If you have custom identifiers, you need to configure your identifier in Senzing. (See [Additional Configuration](https://github.com/missulmer/SZGESv3/blob/main/SESV3.md#additional-configuration) for more information.)

### Organization Issued or Identifiers Attributes

The following identifiers have been added over time and can also be mapped if available.

| Attribute name | Data Type | Example | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| ACCOUNT_NUMBER | String | 1234-1234-1234-1234|This is an account number such as a bank account, credit card number, etc.|
| ACCOUNT_DOMAIN | String | VISA | This is the domain the account number is valid in.
| DUNS_NUMBER | String | 123123 | The unique identifier for a company. ([Learn more.](https://www.dnb.com/duns-number.html))|
| NPI_NUMBER | String | 123123 | A unique ID for covered health care providers. ([Learn more.](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Administrative-Simplification/NationalProvIdentStand/))|
|LEI_NUMBER | String | 123123 | A unique ID for entities involved in financial transactions. ([Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_Entity_Identifier))|

### Websites, Emails, Social Network, and Communications Platform Handle Attributes

The following social media attributes are available.

| Attribute name | Data Type | Example | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| **WEBSITE_ADDRESS** | String | somecompany.com | This is a website address, usually only present for organization entities.|
| **EMAIL_ADDRESS** | String | someone@somewhere.com | This is the actual email address.|
| **LINKEDIN** | String | xxxxx | This is the unique identifier for this social network.|

### Group association Attributes

The groups a person belongs to can also help resolve entities. For example, two contact lists that only have a name and who they work for as valuable attributes.

Group associations do not create [disclosed relationships](#disclosed-relationship-mapping). Group associations help resolve entities, whereas disclosed relationships help relate them. This does not create a  [disclosed relationships](#disclosed-relationship-mapping), instead makes it easier to resolve entities within organizations. For example, Suppose all you have in common between two data sources are name and for whom they work. In that case, a group association can help resolve the Joe Smiths working together at ABC company.

| Attribute name | Data Type | Example | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| EMPLOYER_NAME| String | ABC | Company | This is the name of the organization the person is employed by.|
| GROUP_ASSOCIATION_TYPE | String | MEMBER | This is the type of group an entity belongs to.|
| GROUP_ASSOCIATION_ORG_NAME | String | Group | name | This is the name of the organization an entity belongs to.|
| GROUP_ASSN_ID_TYPE | String | DUNS | When the group a person is associated with has a registered DUNS identifier, place the type of identifier here.|
| GROUP_ASSN_ID_NUMBER | String | 12345 | When the group a person is associated with has a registered identifier, place the identifier here.|

  Important

- Group associations are subject to default entity thresholds to help reduce false positives and keep the system fast. Therefore they will not help resolve _all_ the employees of a large company across data sources. But they could help to resolve the smaller groups of executives, primary contacts, or owners of large companies across data sources.

### Special attribute types and labels

Some features have special labels that add weight to them. For instance, you might find a whole family at a "home" address but only one company (or company facility) at its physical "business" address. You can use the following special labels to augment a feature's weight:

  | Feature | Lable | Notes | Usage |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| NAME |PRIMARY | People can have aka's and nicknames; companies can have DBAs. When the system resolves multiple records into an entity, you will choose the most complete "primary" name over any other type.| Common; needed To help select the best name to display for an entity. |
| ADDRESS | BUSINESS | Companies with multiple facilities or outlets often share corporate phone numbers and website addresses. | Use this label to help break matches based on their physical location. | Common; used to prevent overmatching of companies.|
| PHONE | MOBILE | Home and work phone numbers are usually shared. Use this label to add weight to mobile or "cell" phones as they are shared far less often. | Rare. Only apply if data source reliably uses mobile phones to distinguish entities.|

### How to use

### JSON Example

- `ADDR_TYPE` - Use the “type”attribute in a json list

```json
:
"ADDRESS_LIST": [{
  "ADDR_TYPE": "BUSINESS",
  "ADDR_LINE1": "111 First St",
  "ADDR_CITY": "Anytown",
  :
```

CSV Example

| BUSINESS_ADDR_LINE1 | BUSINESS_ADDR_CITY |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|111 First St | Anytown |

### Disclosed Relationship Mapping

#### Understanding Disclosed Relationships

What do we mean by the term 'disclosed relationship'? Records describing people or organizations may contain specific fields that designate the presence of a relationship, like a spouse, parental role, company owner, and more. Disclosed relationships differ from what Senzing calls 'discovered relationships' because the connection between the entities is *disclosed* in the record data instead of *discovered* in the entity resolution process using data from multiple records.

Disclosed relationships are essential when systems or people make decisions based on a contextual awareness of known relationships between entities. Some data sources keep track of known relationships between entities, such as familial relationships and company hierarchies. This structure allows you to tell the Senzing software about such relationships. Look for a table within the source system that defines such relationships and use them to implement your disclosed relationship mappings.

Examples of disclosed relationships include but are not limited to:

- Spouse
- Mother
- Father
- Parent (company)
- Employer
- Beneficial owner

These relationships can be hierarchical or one-directional, like in the case of "Parent Company."

![Heirarchical Relationship](img/Simple%20Hierarchy.png)

At the same time, others may be bi-directional, like Father, Son, Husband, or Wife. Directional relationships go from one entity to another.

![Detailed bi-directional roles](img/Spouse%20Bi-directional.png)

Technical Terms

| Name | Description|
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Anchor Domain | Anchor Domains describe the feature grouping which identifies entities uniquely. (E.g. Customer_ID or Company_ID.)|
|Anchor Key | An anchor key is the unique identifier within the domain that anchors the connection to an entity.|
|Pointer Domain |The pointer domain points back to the feature grouping (domain), which identifies entities. It will match the anchor domain.|
| Pointer Key |See Anchor Key above. The pointer key points to a specific entity by their ID to connect the relationship.|
|Pointer Role | The pointer role defines the relationship, like SPOUSE or PARENT.|

##### Figure 1: Domain, Pointer, Anchor and Key

#### Attributes for Implementing Disclosed Relationships

| Attribute name | Data Type | Example | Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| REL_ANCHOR_DOMAIN | String | CUSTOMER_ID | This code describes the domain of the rel_anchor_key.The key must be unique within the domain. For instance, customer systems might use the customer_id to define relationships.|
| REL_ANCHOR_KEY | String | 1001| The rel_anchor_key along with the associated domain comprises a unique value that other records can "point" to create a disclosed relationship. | | | | | REL_POINTER_DOMAIN | String | CUSTOMER_ID | See rel_anchor_domain above.
| REL_POINTER_KEY | String | 1001 | See rel_anchor_key above. A rel_pointer_domain and key on one record point to a rel_anchor_domain and key on another record to in order to create a relationship between them.|
| REL_POINTER_ROLE | String | SPOUSE | This is the role the anchor record plays in relationship to the pointer record. Note: Be careful not to use very long names here as so they should appear on the line between two nodes on a graph.

## Attributes for values that not used for entity resolution

Sometimes it is desirable to include additional attributes that can help add further context to what's understood about an entity or relationships in the data. These attributes are not used for entity resolution because they do not help with the entity resolution but are useful additional information stored on the entity to inform people or systems. Senzing comes with a default configuration for features and entities; this is sometimes referred to as 'generic' entity types or features throughout our documentation, comments, and code. Features not configured to create entities or find relationships pass through to the entity's profile. Examples include additional dates, statuses, types, flags, or aggregated amounts at the entity level.

**Examples:**

- The LIFETIME_VALUE of a customer can help determine what kind of discount should be applied to their order or if a new customer is related to a high-value customer.
- The TERMINATION_REASON of an employee can help determine if a new job applicant should be hired or not.
- The BUSINESS_RISK or GEOGRAPHICAL_RISK of a customer may help determine if a high dollar transaction should be reviewed before it executes.
- A vendor related to an employee who influences purchases is more important than the same vendor associated with an employee that doesn't.
- A current company you do business with that is on a watch list for bad reasons is more important than the same match to a company you did business with several years ago.

  On smaller Senzing systems, you may want to include and store additional non-Senzing attributes. On larger Senzing systems, it is best practice to load only the configured attributes used for entity resolution and use a data warehouse or other external system to access additional non-Senzing attributes.

### Loading Data

**Important: Loading data requires converting your source data to the Senzing input format before loading.** If you have not yet completed this step, please review the [Mapping Source Data](#mapping-source-data) section of this document.

### Senzing Evaluations

[Evaluation Data Loading Handbook](handbooks/loading-data-handbook.md)

Select the evaluation deployment method that best fits your situation:

- AWS Senzing Evaluation via Marketplace
- Baremetal on Linux
- Docker-Compose-Demo instance using:
  - RabbitMQ
  - Kafka

## Production Data Operations - Onboarding New Sources

### [Data Operations Handbook](handbooks/data-operations-handbook.md)

**Production Deployments:**

- AWS SQS
- RabbitMQ
- Kafka

## Additional Configuration

  Senzing comes pre-configured with all the features, attributes, and settings you will likely need to begin resolving persons and organizations immediately. However, when you need to configure new features for your entities. A typical example of a custom feature(s) are identifiers unique to your data.

[Feature Configuration Handbook](handbooks/feature-configuration-handbook.md).
This handbook's scope only covers how to configure a custom unique identifier.

If you have unique features or entities that you feel are important for your use cases, [contact Customer Success](https://senzing.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we will guide you through thier creation.

Likewise, you have other entity or feature configuration questions, [please be in touch.](https://senzing.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
